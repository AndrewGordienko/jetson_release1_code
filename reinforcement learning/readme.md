dqn is deep q network. basically a network learns to pick the best move its the easiest and first reinforcement learning algorithm u should do that uses a neural net.

q tabular is just it makes a table and stores the best move for each possible state also technically reinforcement learning because it keeps updating the table based on experiences.

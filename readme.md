this is code i wrote for different stuff. if you want to do cool jetson stuff this will probably be useful for you. i have yet to write tutorials on all the code because that takes a lot of time and im lazy and its arguably harder than writing the code. i see this repo more as a tool for someone who gets interested and gets stuck implementing something and wants to steal code which just works and will help them learn. text me on discord if u want to learn more abt how something works and ill be happy to help.
